## ⚡ Introduction

**Automate everything. Break nothing.**  
This project is a one-stop shop for spinning up cloud infrastructure and automating data workflows—*with zero manual intervention*. Designed for data engineers and DevOps pros, it combines **Terraform**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Python** to create an end-to-end automation pipeline that is secure, scalable, and fully testable.

Whether you're provisioning cloud resources or running data pipelines, this repo gives you the tools to do it right—every single time.

Project Features:

- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Use Terraform to provision and deploy infrastructure consistently.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate builds, testing, and deployments with GitHub Actions.
- **Data Generation**: Python-based scripts for generating sample customer data.
- **Security Scanning**: Integrated with Bandit for static code analysis.
- **Automated Testing**: Ensures code quality using Python testing frameworks.
- **Deployment**: Upon passing all checks, application is deployed to target environment.
